## About me ‚ÑπÔ∏è
Hello, I am Wiktor Markowicz. In 2025, I graduated my master's degree in Computer Science. Testing came into my life quite unexpectedly. While studying, I was looking for an internship as a web developer. One of my messages was answered by a company that offered me a position as a software tester instead of a web developer. Without thinking twice, I agreed. It was a bull's eye! My accuracy, meticulousness, and attention to detail proved to be very useful. Since then, I have been exploring topics related to quality and software testing.

## Experience
Working as a software tester at [Ovoo](https://ovoo.pl/) was my first professional position related to quality control. I significantly developed both my technical and soft skills, such as strong analytical thinking, and gained some knowledge on how to create test cases, how to handle and add tickets on Redmine, and how to create user manuals.

## Tools
‚úÖ [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/pl/software/jira) - for creating reports;

‚úÖ [Slack](https://slack.com/) - for communicating in team;

‚úÖ [Chrome Devtools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools?hl=pl) - to provide more accurate error messages;

‚úÖ [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - API testing;

‚úÖ [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) - query language that allows you to check whether the application is saving data correctly;

## Soft skills
- Strong teamwork skills;
- Effective communication;
- Willingness and motivation to learn and self-develop;
- Ability to work according to strict guidelines;
- Attention to detail and accuracy.

## SQL Practice Project ‚Äì PostgreSQL & PgAdmin

I created a relational database using **PostgreSQL** and managed it through **pgAdmin**. 

### Database Structure
The database consists of four related tables:
- `user` ‚Äì stores user information;
- `order` ‚Äì tracks customer orders;
- `order_item` ‚Äì contains order details;
- `product` ‚Äì describes details about products.

### Tasks Completed
I completed 8 SQL exercises, including:
- Filtering data with `WHERE`
- Joining tables using `INNER JOIN`
- Aggregating results with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
- Sorting and limiting results
